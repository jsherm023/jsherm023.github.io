										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Since I can remember, I have had an extreme passion for music. I grew up discovering my love for not only listening to music but creating it as well. From analyzing Nirvana records and trying to mimic each song by ear on the guitar, to developing an extremely rewarding career in the musical instrument retail industry. Creating something out of nothing is an amazing experience.

										While building up music retail businesses into the e-commerce realm through Amazon, Reverb, eBay, and Wal-Mart, I found that I wanted to do more with software, and not just on the user side. It was easy for me to soon realize that a career in software development was a different, yet fun and exciting avenue for me to express my creativity. I discovered this career through research, after gaining a large interest in music recording software programs like Ableton Live.

										Joining Actualize Coding Bootcamp has been one of the best decisions I have made. I have gained a wealth of knowledge and grown into having a newfound passion that I am unbelievably excited about. My previous work experiences have revolved heavily around analyzing big data sets and fixing problems. The combination of these problem-solving skills and my lifelong desire to be creative feels like a natural extension into this career path. </p>
